# Hello, I'm Ally!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am currently a student at Penn State University, where I am pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity. Alongside my studies, I am expanding my skillset to include coding, with a focus on the following technologies:

- **React**: Building interactive user interfaces.
- **AWS**: Exploring cloud computing services.
- **Google Cloud**: Learning about various cloud-based solutions.

I am enthusiastic about connecting with other individuals who share similar interests or who are working in the tech field. Feel free to reach out!

Let's connect and collaborate!
